Example .bashrc configuration file to get some basic system information when logging in

-> all data should be available for every users .bashrc (no need for extra permissions when running the commands)
-> extracts Hostname, ip address, kernel, filesystems, gateway, logged in users... 
-> filesystems color is configurable based on how much space is used, configure the threshold urself

have fun! :)
